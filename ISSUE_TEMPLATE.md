Describe your issue here.  Some notes:

- The title of your issue should be non-technical.  A business analyst should understand what the issue is.  Even if the issue is very low level, the title should be understandable by anyone who knows what HPI is at a high level. 
- For most issues, you'll want to describe the issue from the user's perspective.  What does the user see?  What is incorrect?
- If possible, describe steps to recreate the issue
- Add your thoughts as to what could be wrong
- Add a screenshot or animated GIF of the problem so that we can quickly see what's going on

- If there's more than one thing to fix, or if you think the issue could be addressed in multiple commits, split out those parts into a checklist:

- [ ] Item One
- [ ] Item Two
