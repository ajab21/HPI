Describe your issue here.  Some notes:

- For most issues, you'll want to describe the issue from the user's perspective.  What does the user see?  What is incorrect?
- If possible, describe steps to recreate the issue
- Add your thoughts as to what could be wrong
- Add a screenshot or animated GIF of the problem so that we can quickly see what's going on
  - Screenshot tool: [Screen Hunter](http://www.wisdom-soft.com/products/screenhunter_free.htm)
  - GIF tool: [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
- If there's more than one thing to fix, or if you think the issue could be addressed in multiple commits, split out those parts into a checklist:

- [ ] Item One
- [ ] Item Two
